Make a Class
------------

Q1. Whatâ€™s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. Const-correctness is the practice of using the `const` keyword 
in C++ to guarantee that data that shouldn't be modified won't be modified. 
Using `const` can prevent errors, ensure interface safety and so forth.

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. Yes. Because this class uses const parameters where they are appropriate, 
and the main function runs well.
